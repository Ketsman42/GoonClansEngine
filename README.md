## Quest System

The quest system is at the heart of GoonClansEngine. It keeps your clan active and engaged through various challenges:

- **Multiple Quest Types:**
  - **Travel:** Track the distance players move (measured in blocks).
  - **Mine:** Monitor progress through block breaking activities.
  - **Kill:** Engage in combat with specific mobs (e.g., Wither Skeletons, Ender Dragon).
  - **Level:** Advance player levels to meet target criteria.

- **Interactive Notifications:**
  - When a quest is ready to be completed, players receive a green chat notification with a **[Complete]** button that, when clicked, executes the command `/clan quest complete <questID>`.

- **5-Minute Per-Quest Cooldown:**
  - To prevent notification spam, each quest's completion message is limited to once every 5 minutes per player. Each quest maintains its own cooldown timer, so different quests can notify independently.

- **Progress Tracking & Auto-Completion:**
  - The plugin continuously monitors player actions (such as moving, mining, killing mobs, and leveling up) and updates quest progress automatically. Some quests complete automatically once their requirements are met.

## Clan Upgrades & Buffs

Enhance your clan's capabilities by investing points earned from quests into valuable upgrades:

- **Shared Clan Chest:**  
  Unlock a centrally managed inventory for storing and sharing items among clan members.

  Increase the size of your shared chest to accommodate more resources.

- **Clan Home Teleport:**  
  Purchase the ability to set a clan home, making it easier for members to regroup quickly.

- **Increase Member Limit:**  
  Expand your clan's maximum member count by unlocking additional slots.

- **Buff System:**  
  Buy clan buffs that give temporary, beneficial potion effects to all online clan members. These buffs can dramatically enhance performance in battles, quests, or general gameplay.

## Clan Relations

Forge alliances or rivalries with other clans to enrich your gameplay experience:

- **Relationship Status:**
  - Assign each clan a relationship status: Friendly, Neutral, or Enemy.
  
- **Collaborative Features:**
  - Friendly clans can transfer points, cooperate during quests, and support each other in PvP situations.
  
- **Competitive Elements:**
  - Engage in clan-versus-clan battles and competitions based on predefined relations.
